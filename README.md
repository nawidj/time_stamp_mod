JVC camcorder videos create .MOD file and .MOI files. The time stamp for the video is saved in the .MOI file. This script adds the time stamp to the .MOD file.

**Note, you will only be able to time stamp a MOD file if its partner MOI file is present in the same folder. When copying MOD files from your camcorder, remember to copy the MOI files into the same folder**

# How to run
run the script in the directory where the files are

```
python time_stamp_mod.py
```
